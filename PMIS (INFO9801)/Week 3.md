## Chapter 3: The business case
### Learning outcomes
- Describe the structure of a business case
- Use the payback, discounted cash flow and the internal rate of return methods to calculate the financial implications of a business case
- Differentiate between tangible and intangible costs and benefits

A business case provides the base for business-level monitoring and control and, ultimately, for assessing whether the project was worth undertaking at all

### Content and format of a business case
1. **Introduction and background** - short introduction setting out what the document is about and sketching any background to the proposed project
2. **Management summary** - is the most important part as it might be the first and only part that the decision makers will turn to. It consists of:
	- A statement of what is the problem or opportunity that the project is intended to address
	- A resume of the options considered and why those not chosen have not been recommended
	- A statement showing which option has been recommended, why, and what business benefits are expected to flow from it
3. **Description of problem or opportunity** - problem that the project is designed to solve or the opportunity it should address
4. **Options available and considered** - Those that are not to be recommended should be described briefly and the reasons for rejecting them should be made clear. The option that is to be recommended should be described in more detail, to allow the readers to see what exactly is being proposed.
5. **Cost/benefit analysis** - presents a description and, where possible, a quantification of the costs of carrying out the project and of the benefits that are expected to flow from it. Costs and benefits are:
	- tangible (which means they can be plausibly quantified in some way) or intangible (which means that they cannot be so quantified), and
	- incurred/enjoyed immediately or in the longer term
6. **Impacts and risks**
	- Impacts, in short, are changes in the way an organization thinks and acts and are worth spelling out in a business case so that the decision-makers can judge whether the proposed changes are feasible or not
	- Outline of the principal risks associated with the recommended option together with the proposed measures for either avoiding or mitigating them, will raise the confidence of the decision-makers that the proposal has been thought through properly
7. **Conclusions and recommendations** - the recommended way forward should be described and the decision that is needed should be set out clearly
8. **Other possible inclusions**

### Investment appraisal (*financial implications)
1. **Payback**
2. **Discounted cash flow**
3. **Internal rate of return**

### Presenting the business case
Four-part formula to present the business case:
1. **Aim** - What decision needs to be made?
2. **Audience** - Who are the decision-makers and what are they interested in?
3. **Arrangement** - using a logical order to present the materials
4. **Appearance** - must be easy for the decision makers to find what they are looking for

### Benefits realization and management
Aim to manage the project in such a way as to maximize the chance of the benefits being achieved. The key to any benefits realization effort is the business case as this is where the benefits have been identified and, where possible, quantified. From the business case, a set of criteria should be developed against which the achievement of the benefits will be measured.
