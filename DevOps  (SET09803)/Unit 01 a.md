# DevOps

##### Toyota Improvement Kata
1. In consideration of a vision or direction...
2. Grasp the current condition
3. Define the next target condition
4. Move toward that target condition iteratively, which uncovers obstacles that need to be worked on

##### A Mind for Numbers
1. Focused thinking requires active attention
2. Diffused thinking requires passive attention

##### An Industry Perspective
- Be present both physically and mentally
- Ask why to me and yourself
- All voices are equal
- Listen actively which normally means close your laptop - take written notes instead
- Don't call people resources which is more about the work place than studying, but keep it in mind when working in teams
- Remember that ego is the enemy

##### Continuous Improvement
1. Have respect for people
2. Continuously improve

##### What is a Software Engineering Method?
- Software Engineering - the application of engineering to the development of software in a systematic method
- Method - is just an approach / series of steps
- Software Development:
	- Conceiving
	- Specifying
	- Designing
	- Programming
	- Documenting
	- Testing
	- Bug fixing
- Engineering - creative application of science, mathematical methods and empirical evidence to design, build and maintain structures, machines, systems and processes
	- Application of science
	- Mathematical methods
	- Empirical evidence
##### Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
- Initiation
- System Concept Development
- Planning
- Requirements Analysis
- Design
- Development
- Integration and Test
- Implementation
- Operation and Maintenance
- Disposition
##### Three Key Methods in Software Development
- Waterfall - each stage must be completed before moving onto the next stage
	- Requirements
	- Analysis
	- Design
	- Coding
	- Testing
	- Operation
- Spiral - builds on waterfall by providing the ability to adapt (iterative nature)
	- Determine objectives
	- Identify and resolve risks
	- Development and test
	- Plan the next iteration
- Agile - builds on the iterative approach, but focus on human-centric ideas where software is evolved by collaboration between teams and customers

##### Agile Manifesto
- Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools
- Working Software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer Collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to Change over following a plan

###### Lean Software Development
- Eliminate waste
- Amplify learning
- Decide as late as possible
- Deliver as fast as possible
- Empower the team
- Build integrity
- See the whole (system and work)

##### Development and Operation (DevOps)
- combination of agile, lean and modern build tools
- developers work closely with operators
- cultural idea in an organization
- Has five goals:
	1.  Improved deployment frequency
	2. Faster time to market
	3. Lower Failure rate of new releases
	4. Shortened lead time between fixes
	5. Faster mean time to recovery

###### DevOps-toolchain
- **Plan** the work to be done and its requirements
- **Create** the software
- **Verify** (testing of the software)
- **Package** the software ready for release/deployment
- **Release** the software
- **Configure** the IT infrastructure
- **Monitor** the running software

##### Metrics for Software Development
- Lead Time - time from when the task is created to when it is completed (should aim to reduce)
- Process Time - time from when work on the task is started until when it is completed
- % C/A - percentage complete and accurate measures the quality of the work produced
