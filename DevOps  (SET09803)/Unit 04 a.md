# The First Way of DevOps - Flow

### The Psychology of Flow
1. Intense and focused concentration on the present moment
2. Merging of action and awareness
3. A loss of reflective self-consciousness
4. A sense of personal control or agency over the situation or activity
5. A distortion of temporal experience, one's subjective experience of time is altered
6. Experience of the activity as intrinsically rewarding
Another three identified components are:
1. Receiving immediate feedback
2. Feeling that you have the potential to succeed
3. Feeling so engrossed in the experience, that other needs become negligible
