# Modern Software Architecture
### Hardware Eras
Three eras of hardware developments:
1. Mainframe - single machines with jobs processed in order
2. PC - saw transition from disconnected computers with physical install media to the Internet
3. Mobile - software is delivered via interfaces on mobile devices

### Software Platforms
1. Desktop Applications 
2. Client-server - server acts as the main host for part or all of the software and the client resides on the user's machine
3. Multitiered Architecture and the Three-tier Architecture
	- divide an application into separate levels of logic to promote reuse
	- simplify communication by having levels only communicate to one sub-layer
	- Three tiers: presentation/UI layer, logic layer and data layer
4. Internet 
5. Service Oriented Architectures - application logic is further divided into different services or APIs which can communicate with different or shared databases
6. Cloud Computing - providing computing-as-a-service
	- Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)
	- Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
	- Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
	- Serverless Computing or Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)
7. Microservices - application is divided into a number of small services
