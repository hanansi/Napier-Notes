## Scrum:
- Is a project management philosophy that regularly checks that your project is heading in the right direction
- Works in iterations called <strong><u>Sprints</u></strong>
	-  Sprints are fixed length of time where a set of tasks will be completed
	- Analyze how well they did at the end of the week
	- Work towards goal in increments
- Inspect and Adapt cycle
	- spot a mistake and fix it straight away 
- Deals with waste
- Awards team based on work

##### Pareto Principle
- 80% of the value comes from 20% of the features
##### Components of Scrum:
- Product Backlog - list of all currently identified tasks
- Task Board - tasks system such as a Kanban board (e.g. Backlog, Sprint, In progress, Done)
- User Stories - allows the team to understand why the task in needed
- Sprints - period of time when a team does work
- Sprint Planning - selects tasks that can be completed during the Sprint (Prioritized task)
- Story Points - tasks are scored based on an estimated cost/point
- Planning Poker - entire team formulates an estimation of each task size using cards
- Daily Standup - daily routine for the team to share and check on each others progress
- Sprint Review and Retrospective - team reflects after a Sprint before moving on to the next one

##### Scrum Team and Roles
- team should contain all the members with the necessary skills needed to deliver the project
- IT Operations are part of your team
- Scrum defines two roles within the team:
	1. Product Owner - decides what the work should be (Backlog)
	2. Scrum Master - helps the team to work as best as they can
- Transparency - everyone in the team knows everything about the tasks

##### Scrum Process
- Produce and initial product backlog
- Prioritize the backlog
- Do an initial estimate of the work
- Decide on what work to do in the next Sprint - Sprint Planning
- Every day have a daily stand-up - Daily Scrum
- End of the Sprint, review - Sprint Review
- Analyze how the team has worked and modify based on the outcome of the review
- Repeat 4-7 until product is delivered to the customer
###### Product Backlog
 - Focus on delivering what is valuable
 - Everything cannot be a priority
 - Time is limited
###### Sprint Planning
- Is the task ready to be done?
- How will you determine when the task is complete?
- Definition of Ready
	- Independent
	- Negotiable
	- Valuable
	- Estimable
	- Small
	- Testable
- Definition of Done - testable condition
###### Sprint Execution
- Do the work
- Work is only completed when it is Done
- Demo at the end of the Sprint (Demo or Die)
###### Daily Standup
- What did you do yesterday to help the team finish the Sprint?
- What will you do today to help the team finish the Sprint?
- What obstacles are getting in the team's way?
###### Sprint Review and Retrospective
 - Count the number of points completed at the then end of the iteration (team **velocity**)
 - delivery = velocity * time of project. Estimate how much you can deliver.
 - date = work / velocity. You know when you can deliver.

##### Being a Team Member
- Team needs to be happy
	- Autonomy
	- Mastery
	- Purpose
- Don't be a bandit or passive team member (Ineffectual people)

##### Work-Life Balance
- Good work-life is more beneficial for individual productivity
- The more you work the worse the work
