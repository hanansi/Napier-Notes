# Requirements Gathering

### What is a Requirement?
IEEE Standard definition:
1. A condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective
2. A condition or capability that must be met or possessed by a system or system component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification, or other formally imposed document
3. A documented representation of a condition or capability as in 1 or 2

|**Term**|**Definition**|
|---|---|
|**Business requirement**|A high-level organisation objective.|
|**Business rule**|A policy, guideline, standard, or regulation that defines or constrains the business.|
|**Constraint**|A restriction on development choices.|
|**External interface requirement**|Requirements on how a system interacts with external users, services, and applications.|
|**Feature**|Capability required by the customer, defined as a set of functional requirements.|
|**Functional requirement**|Behaviour that the system must exhibit.|
|**Nonfunctional requirement**|A property of the system.|
|**Quality attribute**|A nonfunctional requirement for service or performance levels.|
|**System requirement**|Top-level requirement for a large system with multiple components.|
|**User requirement**|Goal or task that a user wishes to perform with the system.|
### Problem and Solutions Domains
![Needs, Features, Requirements](https://github.com/Kevin-Sim/SET09803-DevOps-Global-Online/raw/master/units/unit05/img/problem-domain.png)

- Three distinct requirement types:
	- Business requirements - why the business is building the system
	- User requirements - goals and tasks the user wants to perform
	- Functional requirements - behaviours the product will perform to enable users to complete tasks

### Project Management Triangle (The Iron Triangle)

#### Problems with the Iron Triangle
- Resources and time are estimated
- The quality of the product (requirements are fixed)


### Agile and Requirements
- **Manifesto principle 1** _Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software._
- **Manifesto principle 2** _Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage_.

### Vision Statement
- Vision statement really tries to cover everything about the product we are developing
- The main content of the Vision is the new features for users and the benefits there from
- **System stakeholder** - uses the system (the **users**); – uses the results from the system; – are impacted by the deployment and use of the system
- **Project stakeholder** - has an interest in the budget and delivery date of the project; – has an interest in how the project is deployed; – will be involved in selling, maintaining, etc. (aftercare) of the project deliverable(s)

### Working with Requirements in Agile
- Identified via discovery.
- Maintained by the Product Owner working with the team.
- Prioritised by the Product Owner, on the product backlog
- Scheduled by the team, by pulling them into a Sprint.
- Elaborated by the team by asking questions
- Implemented by the team.
- Tested by the team (unit test, functional test, acceptance test).
- Accepted by the Product Owner as complete, based on the Definition of Done.

### Product Owner
The Product Owner must (taken from _Agile Software Requirements_):
- determine requirements by working with product managers, business analysts, customers, and other stakeholders.
- maintain the backlog and prioritise based on relative user value.
- set iteration objectives.
- elaborate stories, participate in progress reviews, and accept new stories.

The Product Owner also supports requirements at the Sprint Planning Meeting:
- reviewing the iteration objective.
- presenting each backlog item, individually, for discussion.
- supporting the team as they discuss each item until it is well enough understood to implement and estimate.

### Requirements Discovery
- Requirements workshops.
- Brainstorming.
- Interviews and questionnaires.
- User experience mock-ups.
- Product council.
- Competitive analysis.
- Customer change request systems.
- Use-case modelling.

### Release Planning
- Release planning leads to a **roadmap** which defines how value will be delivered over time. 
- A series of planned release dates are defined, each date with a theme, objectives, and features.

### Start With Why
The three questions Sinek defines are:
- Why you do it (the needs).
- How you do it (the features).
- What you do (the requirements).
