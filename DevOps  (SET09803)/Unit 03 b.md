# The Three Ways - Underpinning Principles of DevOps

### Overview of DevOps
- DevOps tries to address the boundary between the developers and operations
- Technical dept - quick and easy solutions lead to long-term problems

### What is DevOps?
- A software development methodology that aims to shorten the systems development life cycle
- Three Ways of DevOps:
	1. Flow
	2. Feedback
	3. Continual Experimentation and Learning

### The First Way of DevOps: The Principles of Flow
- Flow is about work flowing from left to right: from the Development Team, to the Operations Team, and finally the customer
- **Make Work Visible** - methods such as Kanban boards are used to in a IT organisation
- Limit Work in Progress (WiP)
- No one can multitask (consider the cost of **context switch time**)
- Reduce Batch Sizes
- Reduce the Number of Handoffs
- Continually Identify and Elevate Our Constraints - find out what is slowing down the work and fix it until it is not a problem, then find the new problem slowing down the work
- Eliminate Waste and Hardship in the Value Stream

### The Second Way of DevOps: The Principles of Feedback
- Working Safely with Complex Systems
- See Problems as They Occur
- Swarm and Solve Problems to Build New Knowledge
- Keep Pushing Quality Closer to the Source
- Enable Optimising for Downstream Work Centres - focus on where the work goes next

### The Third Way of DevOps: The Principles of Continual Learning and Experimentation
- Enabling Organisational Learning and a Safety Culture - we want to be a generative organisation
- Institutionalise the Improvement of Daily Work - schedule time to fix defects and improve the code base
- Transform Local Discoveries into Global Improvements - create mechanisms to share knowledge within the organisation
- Inject Resilience Patterns into Our Daily Work - experiment with how work is conducted
- Leaders Reinforce a Learning Culture
